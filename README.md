#### Robin's Plants ####

A website created with Next.js, PostgreSQL-14, and LuciaAuth aimed to allow users to share photos and relevant plant information via blog posts to keep track of and receive input on plant growth.
!!! This is a WIP !!!

The directory contains a Dockerfile, which *may* help you run this project locally as a test - however there are a few env variables not included that will have to be manually updated.
You will also need an instance of PostgreSQL running with a relevant schema setup. In the future, I will batch SQL queries together to initialize the needed DB tables.
